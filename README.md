# Usage

If I am the owner of a rental property, when I login, I am brought to a dashboard with all my properties and their information. I am also able to make to-do and see any requests my tenants have made. I am also able to see the details of each property such as sq ft, number of beds/baths, and its address. If I am a tenet I can log in and submit a maintenance/service request.
