# Description

This is a website to be used by both a real estate manager/owner and the tenets who are renting. Tenets and Landlords will have their separate landing page with relavant information.

# Installation

bcrypt, connect-session-sequelize, dotenv, express, express-handlebars, express-session, handlebars, mysql2, and sequelize

# Usage

If I am the owner of a rental property, when I login, I am brought to a dashboard with all my properties and their information. I am also able to make to-do and see any requests my tenants have made. I am able to pull up each tenant's information if I need to contact them. I am also able to see the details of each property such as sq ft, number of beds/baths, and its address. If I am a tenet I am able to login and see just the property I live in and send requests to my landlord if any issues arise.
